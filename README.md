# objection-example-express-es7
> Simple Object.js ORM example copied from Vincit/objection.js

This example was copied from folder [examples/express-es7](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/tree/master/examples/express-es7) of [github.com/Vincit/objection.js](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js)

The original client code that makes HTTP requests is in [client.js](client.js) but for this demo we are going to use [Cypress Test Runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) with [@bahmutov/cy-api](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-api) plugin.
